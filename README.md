# 1. Diabities Prediction
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine whether an individual has diabetes based on specific health metrics. The project workflow includes data preprocessing, model development, and deployment of the model as a web application.
1. Data Source: The dataset used for this project is the PIMA Indian Diabetes Database, which contains various health-related attributes.
2. Algorithms Used: Various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were tested.
3. The best-performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics.
4. Flask Framework: The selected machine learning model was integrated into a Flask web application.
